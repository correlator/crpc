              It was 11:48 p.m., the night before my daughter&apos;s science fair project was due. The kitchen table was covered in glitter, glue sticks, and ambition. She was proud — and nervous. I just had to hit &quot;Print&quot; on her colorful trifold title. One click and we&apos;d be done.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Except nothing happened.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Just a blinking error message on the screen: &quot;Unrecognized cartridge.&quot; I stared at it. Then hit &quot;Retry.&quot; Then again. Still nothing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              I had saved eight bucks buying a &quot;compatible&quot; cartridge online — one of those off-brand deals with a dozen glowing reviews and a price tag that whispered &quot;why not?&quot;
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Now I was whispering things I shouldn&apos;t repeat in front of a child.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              We rebooted. Removed and reinserted the cartridge. Held our collective breath. Still, the printer refused to recognize it. My daughter&apos;s proud smile crumbled as fast as her sleep schedule. I ended up driving across town to a 24-hour copy shop, paying triple just to print three pages.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              That $8 &quot;deal&quot;? It cost me $47 in emergency printing, three hours of sleep, and the look on my daughter&apos;s face that said, &quot;Dad… why didn&apos;t we just use the good one?&quot;

      {/* Hidden Cost section */}
      <div className="bg-gray-100 py-16">
        <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">

            <h2 className="text-gray-900 text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">The Hidden Cost of Clone Cartridges</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              I wish I could say this was just a one-time inconvenience. But that experience opened a rabbit hole of research — and regret.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              Turns out, that cartridge I bought wasn&apos;t just unrecognized. It was likely a counterfeit clone — a single-use knockoff, falsely labeled as &quot;remanufactured,&quot; made to look legit while skirting quality standards and copyright laws. It was cheap because it was engineered to be disposable — for me and for the planet.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">These clones can:</p>
            <ul className="text-gray-900 list-disc pl-5">
              <li>Leak or clog printheads</li>
              <li>Damage your printer long-term</li>
              <li>Display false ink levels</li>
              <li>Trigger firmware lockouts</li>
              <li>Void warranties</li>
              <li>Fill landfills with unrecyclable plastic</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              And the kicker? Most can&apos;t be reused. Unlike legitimate remanufactured cartridges that are cleaned, rebuilt, and refilled, clone compatibles are often dead-on-arrival for the circular economy.

      {/* Better Choices section */}
      <div className="bg-white py-16">
        <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">

            <h2 className="text-gray-900 text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">From Frustration to Better Choices</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              After that night, I started paying closer attention. I found suppliers that offer certified remanufactured cartridges — actual reused originals, tested for quality and rebuilt to perform just like new. They&apos;re not just cheaper than OEM cartridges — they work, they last, and they don&apos;t lie about what they are.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              And they keep thousands of tons of plastic from hitting landfills every year.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              That felt like a better way to print.

      {/* Why This Matters section */}
      <div className="bg-gray-100 py-16">
        <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
          <div className="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-gray-900">
            <h2 className="text-gray-900 text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">Why This Story Matters</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              We all want to save money. But clone compatibles don&apos;t just cost us in surprise breakdowns and late-night copy runs. They chip away at trust. At sustainability. At the possibility of a better, smarter printing industry that isn&apos;t built on deception and waste.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              So here&apos;s the simple truth: If you&apos;re not buying original or certified remanufactured, you&apos;re probably getting scammed.

      <div className="bg-white py-16">
        <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">

            <h2 className="text-gray-900 text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">Look for the CRPC Mark</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              To make sure you&apos;re getting the real thing, look for cartridges verified by the Certified Remanufactured Printer Cartridge (CRPC) program. The CRPC seal is your assurance that a product has been:
            </p>
            <ul className="text-gray-900 list-disc pl-5">
              <li>Professionally remanufactured from an original OEM core</li>
              <li>Backed by responsible reuse practices and sustainability standards</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              By choosing CRPC-certified cartridges, you support companies that prioritize truth-in-labeling, environmental responsibility, and fair competition.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900 font-bold mt-8">
              Print smarter. Waste less. And never fall for a fake again. Because eight bucks isn&apos;t a deal if it costs you everything else.
