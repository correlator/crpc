              [City, State], [Date] â€” The Certified Remanufactured Printer Cartridges (CRPC) has been established to combat false labeling and counterfeit products misrepresented as remanufactured and marketed as recycled. The CRPC&apos;s mission is to verify remanufacturers, certifying their products as &quot;genuine remanufactured&quot; to provide clarity and trust in the marketplace.

              As demand grows for sustainable solutions to reduce waste, some companies exploit this trend by &quot;greenwashing&quot; products with false environmental claims, including mislabeling items as &quot;remanufactured.&quot; Remanufacturing involves restoring used products to like-new condition by disassembling, inspecting, repairing, or replacing components, and reassembling them to meet original performance standards, offering warranties comparable to new items. This sustainable practice, widely used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, printer cartridges, and electronics, differs significantly from simple repair or refurbishment by ensuring quality, functionality, and durability.

              Unscrupulous manufacturers often produce counterfeit products labeled as &quot;remanufactured,&quot; engaging in deceptive, anti-competitive, and potentially dangerous practices that undermine circular economies. The CRPC seeks to distinguish genuine remanufactured products from fakes, helping law enforcement and marketplaces combat fraudulent claims while protecting consumers.

            <p className="text-gray-900">
              In spring 2025, the CRPC will launch its CRPC Certified Remanufactured Printer Cartridges verification program, targeting the printer cartridge remanufacturing industry.

            <p className="text-gray-900">
              The CRPC is dedicated to fostering a sustainable, circular economy by evaluating, approving, and promoting certified remanufactured products while ensuring adherence to truth-in-labeling standards. It collaborates with remanufacturers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), online marketplaces, retailers, recyclers, and government entities to drive adoption of the CRPC program and distinguish remanufactured products.
